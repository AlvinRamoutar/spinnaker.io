  A pipeline trigger defines when to automatically run a pipeline
---

There are many types of triggers available: Jenkins jobs, webhooks, CRON jobs,
even other pipelines. Adding a trigger to your pipeline means that the pipeline
runs each time the triggering event occurs.

Note that whether or not you have set up a pipeline trigger, you can always
[run your pipeline manually](/docs/guides/user/pipeline/managing-pipelines#manually-run-a-pipeline).
