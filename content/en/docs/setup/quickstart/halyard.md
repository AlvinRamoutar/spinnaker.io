 > Note: we recommend that you install Spinnaker following the [standard setup directions](/docs/v1.19/setup/) rather than the guides listed here.

[Demo installs](/docs/v1.19/setup/quickstart/) are self-contained simple Spinnaker installations that don't require Halyard. But you can do a fairly quick <em>full</em> install using Halyard, and here
are a few configurations to get you started. If your environment matches one of these, click through for instructions.
